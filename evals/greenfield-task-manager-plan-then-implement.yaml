    description: >
      Tests Claude's ability to first analyze an existing codebase and create
      a plan, then implement a new API endpoint following existing patterns.
      The two-phase approach ensures Claude understands the codebase before
      making changes.
    task: >
      Build a task management CLI application with the following capabilities:
      1. Add, list, update, and delete tasks
      2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
      3. Assign priorities (low, medium, high)
      4. Filter and search tasks
      5. Persist tasks to a JSON file
      6. Support for due dates

          Build a task management CLI application that allows users to:
          - Add, list, update, and delete tasks
          - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
      - name: implementation

        prompt_template: >
          Implement the following plan that was created in the planning phase:

          {previous_result}

          Create all necessary files in the current working directory.
          Do not ask for approval - just implement the plan autonomously.
