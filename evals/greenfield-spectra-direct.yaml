    name: Spectra Full Workflow Simulation (Direct)
    description: >
      Simulates the complete spectra workflow: specify, plan, tasks, implement.
      Tests multi-command sequential workflows for complex project development.
      Direct implementation, no agent.
    task: >
      With direct implementation, spectra command, build a task management CLI application with the following capabilities:
      1. Add, list, update, and delete tasks
      2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
      3. Assign priorities (low, medium, high)
      4. Filter and search tasks
      5. Persist tasks to a JSON file
      6. Support for due dates

          CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE:
          1. DO NOT present options or ask for user input
          2. DO NOT stop to explain constraints or limitations
          3. DO NOT ask which phase to implement - implement ALL phases
          4. Implement ALL tasks from tasks.md one by one without stopping
          5. Keep going until every single task is marked [x] complete
          6. If you encounter any issues, work around them and continue
          7. This is an automated evaluation - there is NO user to respond to questions
