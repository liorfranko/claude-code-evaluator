    description: >
      Simulates the complete spectra workflow: specify, plan, tasks, implement.
      Tests multi-command sequential workflows for complex project development.
      Agent implementation, no direct implementation.
    task: >
      With agent implementation, spectra command, build a task management CLI application with the following capabilities:
      1. Add, list, update, and delete tasks
      2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
      3. Assign priorities (low, medium, high)
      4. Filter and search tasks
      5. Persist tasks to a JSON file
      6. Support for due dates
